<h2>About &amp Contact</h2>
<p>My name is Dominic Doty, as you might have gathered, and I am studying Mechanical Engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I'm interested in a variety of things like product design, hydraulics, automation, cars,
model gliders, digital circuit design, 3d printing, surfing, and dabbling in programming.</p>

<p>I wrote this website mostly from scratch, with general cues taken from other Jekyll sites and HTML5 Boilerplate. The site is statically generated by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. 
All my HTML and CSS knowledge comes from the extremely helpful <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. You like this layout? Go ahead and <a href="http://www.github.com/dominicdoty/dominicdoty.github.io" target="_blank">fork it on github</a>. Copy the whole thing! Change it all! Change nothing! Who cares!</p>

<p>What's this "Monetized by Viglink" nonsense you ask? If I post a link to a product and you go and buy it, I might get a small commission, no cost to you. It's a tiny way for me to support registering the domain name and any other small debts that accrue on behalf of the website.</p>

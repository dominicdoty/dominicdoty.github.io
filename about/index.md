### Interests
My name is Dominic Doty, I'm interested in a variety of things like embedded systems programming and hardware design, digital circuits, robotics, automation, wireless technologies, product design, 3D printing, cars, model gliders, and hydraulics to name a few.

### Background
I got my Undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo with a concentration in Mechatronics.

After, I worked as a manufacturing engineer at SpaceX for just a few days short of 3 years. I was responsible for the manufacture of the Dragon 1 metallic structure, and then later the manufacture of the Dragon 2 metallic structure. I learned a lot about machining, welding, drilling, precision assembly, and many other things.

Eventually I decided I'd like to pursue a career in robotics and embedded systems, which is how I ended up at the University of Colorado Boulder studying for a Master's in Embedded Systems Engineering. Depending on when I last updated this, I may still be at CU, or finished and moving on to something else.

Monetized by Viglink means that if I post a link to a product and you go buy it, I may get a small comission at no cost to you. I basically get nothing out of it at this point but it was free to setup so why the heck not. Click on the icon at the bottom for more info.

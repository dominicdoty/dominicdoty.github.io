		<p class="p-1">Hi, I'm Dominic.</p>
		<p class="p-1">
			I'm a mechanical and electrical engineer (undergrad and grad respectively), with a background
			in aerospace and defense.
		</p>
		<p class="p-1">
			Most recently I've been working as an embedded systems engineer on FPGA HDL development for
			phased arrays for communications and radar.
		</p>
		<p class="p-1">
			I spend most of my time writing HDL and C for Xilinx SoCs, usually in embedded linux but
			sometimes in FreeRTOS.
		</p>
		<p class="p-1">I also spend a good bit of time in Python for tooling development.</p>

		<!-- TODO: add info about the site svelte and stuff, git link -->
		<p class="p-1">
			This site was developed from scratch using Svelte and is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. It was
			originally developed in the Jekyll SSG, but was re-written for no good reason after I learned
			about Svelte in a personal project.

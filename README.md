Jekyll source for my personal site.

I wrote this website mostly from scratch, with general cues taken from other Jekyll sites and HTML5 Boilerplate. The site is statically generated by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. 
All my HTML and CSS knowledge comes from the extremely helpful <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>.

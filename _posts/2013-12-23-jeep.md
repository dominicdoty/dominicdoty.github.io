My Dad got himself a 1988 Jeep Wrangler YJ, with a yucky old dash. He wanted to go for a more flat and clean look, so I installed this custom dashboard.

I first tore out the old dash, which was a good deal of fun. I found some Hotwheels cars stuck in places they shouldn't be, as well as a lot of trash and nasties. I tracked and labelled all the wires I'd need, and cross-referenced them with the wiring diagram. This is where I started to find some hints of issues. One of the car's previous owners swapped the original engine out with the hearty and common inline six, as well as switching it from a manual to an automatic. This means that the wiring harness has been messed with thoroughly. It is a conglomeration of multiple years and lots of weird changes. I found a remote start and two separate alarm systems under the dash, none of them working at the time we got the car. It was a mess.

I spent a lot of time cleaning up the dash, tracking down wires, fixing splices, and general maintenance. Many wires would run all around the car and then simply be unconnected at the end. I cut out lots of junk. It took too long and the Jeep needed to go on a big hunting trip, so I rigged up a temporary dash to get a speedometer and gas gauge running.
